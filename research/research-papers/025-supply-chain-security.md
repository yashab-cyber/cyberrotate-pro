## Abstract

This research examines supply chain security risks in technology ecosystems, analyzing vendor vulnerabilities, third-party dependencies, and software supply chain attacks. We present comprehensive risk assessment frameworks and mitigation strategies.

## Keywords
Supply chain security, vendor risk, third-party vulnerabilities, software dependencies, SBOM
