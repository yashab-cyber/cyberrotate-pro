## Abstract

This research investigates Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns, analyzing attack methodologies, persistence mechanisms, and defense strategies. We present comprehensive frameworks for APT detection and mitigation in enterprise environments.

## Keywords
Advanced Persistent Threats, APT detection, threat intelligence, lateral movement, persistence mechanisms

## 1. Introduction

Advanced Persistent Threats represent sophisticated, long-term cyber campaigns targeting specific organizations. This research develops comprehensive detection and mitigation strategies against APT operations.
