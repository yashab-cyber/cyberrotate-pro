## Abstract

This research examines contemporary web application security threats, analyzing attack vectors, vulnerability patterns, and defense mechanisms. We present comprehensive security frameworks for modern web application development and deployment.

## Keywords
Web application security, OWASP Top 10, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, secure development
