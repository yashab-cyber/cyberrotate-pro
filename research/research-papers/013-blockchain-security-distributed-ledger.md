## Abstract

This comprehensive study examines security properties of blockchain technologies and distributed ledger systems, analyzing consensus mechanisms, smart contract vulnerabilities, and scalability solutions. We present novel security frameworks and evaluate their effectiveness in preventing common attack vectors.

## Keywords
